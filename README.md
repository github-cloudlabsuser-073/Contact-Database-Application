## Poetry Corner

In the spirit of creativity and to add a touch of beauty to our project, here's a lovely poem:

> In the heart of the code, in the depth of the binary,
> Lies a craft so profound, that shapes the contemporary.
> Through the syntax and logic, in each line that we weave,
> Lies a world of wonder, only a coder perceives.
